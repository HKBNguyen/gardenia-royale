# Gardenia Royale

duck game esque but with pixel art versions of people from gardenia 4 (maybe with different stats)

## Controls

wasd and e or arrow keys and slash (2 player, 1 keyboard)

left and right arrows move left and right,
up arrow jumps, 
down arrow punches if no gun, shoots if character has a gun
slash picks up an item (or throws the equipped item?)

## Items

* Health pack: restores a bit of health 
* Short Gun: a weak-ish gun that is dropped by itself
* Crate: a crate that drops a random long gun when destroyed
* Long Gun: a more powerful gun that is dropped from crates
